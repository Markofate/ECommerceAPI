# ECommerceAPI

A modular, full‑stack e‑commerce application composed of an ASP.NET Core Web API backend and a React frontend. It provides the core building blocks for a modern online store: catalog browsing, shopping cart, checkout, and basic administration.

This repository follows a clean, layered architecture to keep domain logic, data access, and presentation concerns separated and maintainable.

## Features

Core capabilities typically included in this solution:

- Storefront
  - Product catalog with categories
  - Product details, variants/options (if modeled)
  - Search, filtering, sorting, and pagination
  - Shopping cart (basket) management
  - Checkout flow and order creation
- User & Security
  - User registration and login
  - Role-based authorization for admin endpoints (if enabled)
  - JWT-based auth and secure API access (commonly used)
- Administration
  - CRUD for products, categories, and related entities
  - Order management basics (view orders, status updates)
- Developer Experience
  - Layered solution with clear separation of concerns
  - Strongly-typed models and DTOs
  - Swagger/OpenAPI for interactive API docs (if enabled)
  - Dockerfile for containerized deployment

Note: Exact features depend on the implementation in this repo. See the API controllers and React pages/components for specifics.

## Architecture

This solution uses a layered, clean-style architecture:

- Entities: Domain models (e.g., Product, Category, Cart, Order) and DTOs/contracts
- DataAccess: Repository/data layer, database context, and persistence concerns
- Business: Application/business services, rules, validations, and orchestration
- Core: Cross-cutting utilities (e.g., result wrappers, exceptions, extensions)
- ECommerceAPI: ASP.NET Core Web API host (controllers, startup/program, configuration)
- ReactWeb: React frontend for the storefront and/or admin UI
- Documentation: Diagrams, specifications, and supplementary docs

This structure promotes:
- Testability: Each layer can be validated independently
- Maintainability: Changes in one layer minimally impact others
- Scalability: Clear boundaries for adding features and integrations

---

## Tech Stack

- Backend:
  - C# / ASP.NET Core Web API
  - Dependency Injection, Middleware, Filters
  - Entity Framework Core or repository pattern for data access (commonly used)
  - Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation (if enabled)
- Frontend:
  - React (JavaScript)
  - CSS/HTML for styling and layout
- Tooling & Infra:
  - Dockerfile for containerization
  - GitHub Actions or other CI/CD (optional)
  - SQL database (SQL Server/PostgreSQL/etc. depending on configuration)

Language footprint in this repo indicates a React-heavy frontend with a .NET API:
- JavaScript, C#, CSS, HTML, Dockerfile

## API Overview

Typical endpoints you may find (exact routes may vary):

- Catalog
  - GET /api/products
  - GET /api/products/{id}
  - GET /api/categories
- Cart/Basket
  - GET /api/basket
  - POST /api/basket/items
  - PUT /api/basket/items/{itemId}
  - DELETE /api/basket/items/{itemId}
- Orders
  - POST /api/orders
  - GET /api/orders/{id}
  - GET /api/orders (current user)
- Auth
  - POST /api/auth/register
  - POST /api/auth/login
  - GET /api/auth/profile
- Admin (protected)
  - POST/PUT/DELETE /api/products
  - POST/PUT/DELETE /api/categories

Filtering, sorting, and pagination are commonly supported via query parameters, e.g.:
```
GET /api/products?search=shirt&category=men&sort=price_desc&page=2&pageSize=20
```

For the exact contract, see the controllers under `ECommerceAPI` and any DTOs under `Entities`, and check Swagger if available.


## Roadmap Ideas

- Payments integration (Stripe, PayPal)
- Inventory and stock management
- Promotions, coupons, discounts
- Wishlists and product reviews
- Internationalization (i18n) and localization
- Advanced search (facets) and recommendations
- Admin dashboard and analytics
- CI/CD pipeline with environment-specific deployments
